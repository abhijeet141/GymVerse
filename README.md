# GymVerse - Gym Website
GymVerse is a web application built using ReactJs, MaterialUI, and RapidAPI. It showcases my mastery of React by building a dynamic, interactive gym website with a set of activities.

The usage of Material UI (MUI) style library demonstrates my understanding of contemporary and aesthetically pleasing design. The combination of React and MUI highlights my focus on offering a seamless and easy-to-use user experience for visitors to the gym website.
